## A short summary of my first projects in Python

Python is one of the most popular programming languages ​​today.

Since our programming learning was also accompanied by Python learning, we used various tools, including the Tortoise library, in presenting the projects.

One of the ideas in the Tortoise library to make beautiful designs is to use reversible functions.
These types of functions can be used to create famous fractals such as the triangular fractal.

But more interestingly, we used recursive functions to create designs derived from nature.
For example, these functions can be used to execute the sequential designs of the branches of a tree. In the same way, we decided to create first a tree and then a forest in addition to fractals.

Our projects were as follows::
- Triangle fractal
- Stellar fractal
- Tree
- Jungle
