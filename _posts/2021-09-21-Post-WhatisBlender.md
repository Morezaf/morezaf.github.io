title: What is Blender

## One of my most enjoyable experiences

Blender is one of the animation design tools that can meet the needs of an animator from beginner to advanced.

My personal experience with this program dates back to the quarantine period of the corona virus, when I started working with it at the suggestion of one of my friends.

Learning this art like anything else in today's age is possible through the internet.

You can use courses and tutorials to learn more in places like YouTube, and you can get new and interesting ideas from apps like Instagram.

With Blender, you can start with something as simple as a toy car made just by reshaping a cube, and work your way up to bigger things like animating and lighting up a real Porsche on the highway.

This was my first experience working with Blender, which happened during one of the online classes:
